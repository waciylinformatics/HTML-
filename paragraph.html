<h2>HTML Concepts</h2>

<p>
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
    Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior 
    (JavaScript).

<h2>CSS Concepts</h2>

<p> 
    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. 
    Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
    recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is
    now CSS without a version number.
